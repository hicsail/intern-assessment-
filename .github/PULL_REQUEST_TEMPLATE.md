Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
    Jaideep Singh

2. How long did you work on this project?
    I worked on this project for about 90 minutes

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
    This project has been a great experience and trying to troubleshoot Sequelize sync issues has been a hurdle. Learning and fixing the database connections and also handling the edge cases was a bit challenging.

4. What did you learn from this project?
    I learned a lot about working with Node.js and Express, particularly in building RESTful APIs. I also gained hands-on experience with Sequelize ORM for interacting with the SQLite database. Additionally, I became more comfortable with error handling and ensuring data integrity across various database operations.

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
    A more realistic model would not allow public access. If I were to suggest one thing, I would consider user authentication and making the frontend of the project more welcoming and user friendly.

6. What is your feedback on this project?
    I think the project was well-designed for learning basic CRUD operations using Express and Sequelize. The API functionality is solid, but I feel the project could benefit from additional features like user authentication.
