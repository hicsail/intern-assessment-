   - I have never used the sequelize library before so I had to sift through documentation to learn how to use it.

   - I learned how sqlite and sequelize interact with an express server and how to use them to write CRUD operations to a database.


5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
   - If you could be alotted more time to work on this project, I think adding a frontend component (e.g. connecting the front and backend as well as displaying the queried data on a browser) to this project would be a good way to showcase fullstack skills. 
   - I personally use nodemon in my personal projects so that when I make any changes the server restarts automatically. I think adding nodemon as a dev dependency would be a good addition to this project in the future.
