Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
    Moiz Amjad

2. How long did you work on this project?
    1.5 hours

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
    - Initially it was challenging to understand how to run the project and what exactly I was required to do as I had not dealt with local servers before. Upon a lot of googling, I was able to understand the task better, including how to run it and what exactly I had to do.

4. What did you learn from this project?
    - I learned how to implement CRUD operations on a local server so now I am condifent I will be able to do it much faster in the future. 

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
    - I would like to add more robust error handling and validation for user inputs, such as checking for edge cases like extremely long task titles or invalid data types. 
    - Additionally, I would like to improve how the tasts are listed to make them more readable both on the user's end and on the server's end whenever a CRUD operation is performed.

6. What is your feedback on this project?
    - I think the project was straightforward and served as a great introduction to CRUD operations with a local server. However, I believe clearer instructions on how to run the server could help beginners save some time during the initial setup.

7. What is your suggestion for this project?
    - I think adding a frontend or UI would make the app more engaging and provide an opportunity to connect the backend with a client-side application.
