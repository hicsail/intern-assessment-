Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
Bardan Dhakal

2. How long did you work on this project?
1 hr 50 min

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
The most challenging part of this project was handling the list completed and incompleted tasks requirement. Since, I had already implemented the list all task requirements via a GET /tasks route, the new route that I implemented to filter tasks based upon completion was not working because the first GET /tasks route was always implemented. Therefore the second route that implemented filtering based on completion never worked. This took me a while to figure out and I solved the issue by merging the two routes.

4. What did you learn from this project?
I learned how to build a RESTful API that supports CRUD operations for task management. Additionally, I gained experience in working with query parameters for filtering data, Debugging path conflicts and improving the overall structure and error handling of a Node.js application

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
I would like to add a search functionality to allow the users to search tasks by keywords and soft deletion where deleted tasks can be recovered if needed by the user.

6. What is your feedback on this project?
This project is a great exercise to learn full-stack development concepts especially API design.
