Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
Nafisa Nawrin Labonno

2. How long did you work on this project?
Approximately an hour and a half to two hours

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
Understanding the different files that needed to be updated. Upon starting, I saw preexisting files which needed to be explained further to me. Because this is my first time using any database (previously worked in a team who knew MongoDB to some degree) and SQL, this was equally fun and challenging! I just got done with object-oriented in Java and C++ so having to review them/work under timed constraints in a real-life project as a starter was quite interesting! I hope the requirements are met justly. Initially, I also faced issues running the port correctly. It threw me an error constantly so debugging that was slightly disturbing.

4. What did you learn from this project?

A lot. 1. If I can learn how to finish this on time, I think anyone else can too. 2. Making small scale side projects would make my life so much easier~ 3. APIs are really interesting, not just from a web dev POV but from the perspective of a user, I wouldn't have found the incredulous amount of things that can be possible just with APIs and making their usage more efficient across various web development related areas.

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
Automate user's To-Do list and add suggestions. Perhaps even add AI but not a chatbot. For simiplicity, I would like to make it a little bit more distraction free so I'm yet to figure out how I can do that without having notifications.

6. What is your feedback on this project?

It was a great learning experience, if not anything. I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this assessment!
